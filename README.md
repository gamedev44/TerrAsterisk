**RealWorld Cartographic Heightmap Data - Bringing Scalable Terrain in Seconds**

## Overview
TerrAsterisk is an open-source utility designed to streamline access to cartographic heightmap data, making life easier for cinematic artists, game developers, and architectural visualization (archviz) engineers. With TerrAsterisk, you can quickly acquire scalable, real-world terrain data to use in your projects.

Whether you're building immersive game worlds, creating detailed cinematic environments, or visualizing architectural landscapes, TerrAsterisk offers a simple, efficient way to access terrain data with minimal effort.

## Features
- **Instant Access**: Quickly extract heightmap data for use in your projects.
- **Optimized UI**: A distraction-free, responsive interface tailored to maximize productivity.
- **Customization**: Includes a custom header and navigation button to easily access related resources.
- **Scalable Integration**: Forms the foundation for an upcoming editor utility widget plugin, which will include additional tools and features.

## Data Sources
TerrAsterisk leverages open data sources to bring you accurate, high-resolution heightmap information, including:
- **OpenStreetMap contributors**
- **USGS (U.S. Geological Survey)**
- **ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute)**
- **NASA SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission)**

These data sources provide reliable and up-to-date cartographic information for creating detailed terrains.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terrasterisk.git
    ```
2. Open the `terrasterisk.html` file in your browser:
    ```bash
    open terrasterisk.html
    ```
3. Begin exploring and extracting terrain data immediately!

## Customization
- Modify the header text and colors directly in the HTML file to fit your project's theme.
- Update the navigation button image or the redirect URL by adjusting the `<button>` element in the code.

## Future Development
TerrAsterisk is a part of a larger open-source initiative aimed at developing a robust **editor utility widget plugin**. This plugin will feature a suite of powerful tools, including TerrAsterisk, to enhance workflows for artists, developers, and engineers.

## Use Cases
- **Cinematic Artists**: Generate realistic terrains for your scenes and visual storytelling.
- **Game Developers**: Integrate accurate heightmap data into your game engines for detailed landscapes.
- **Architectural Visualization**: Utilize real-world data to create convincing visualizations of your designs.
